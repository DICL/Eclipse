BRIEFING
========

Eclipse is a novel experimental MapReduce framework integrated with distributed
semantic caches and Chord based Distributed Hash Table file system.

Eclipse was created to satisfy the need for better performance in the Hadoop framework.
Eclipse outperforms better by addressing some key facts such as dealing with the 
HDFS storage bottleneck, providing a better concurrency scheduling, imposing austere 
memory management and implementing an efficient suffle phase.
